My elevator pitch.


What is my focus - connecting smarphones to computers.

So what test - Why should anyone care about this? Target audience should be developers normal users should not care.

What do i bring to the discussion of this area? Skills?

First start with some nice sounding buzzwords.
Later give a description on the current state of art.
Stop with a nice sounding slogan.

Everyone has a smarthone and most people also have a computer. But almost no applications are created with this in mind. They are either for the phone or the computer no overlapp exists. This is a shame since it makes the phone-computer interaction space quite limited. Why then are not more applications created with this inmind? One possible explenation could be that developers don't have the resources they need to implement the required comminucation. Therby making the implementation of these interactions more costly and more difficlt then they should be. In my upcomming report i will show how to setup a system that enables phones and computers to find each other aswell as get direct and local comminucation between them. In the hope that this will make it simpler for others to setup their own.
