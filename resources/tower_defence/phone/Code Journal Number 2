Code Journal Number 2. 

What have i done so far? 
I made a logging application using C# and Winforms.
The logging application has the following features. 

1. Multiple diffrent tabs with logging information (From diffrent connections)
2. Ability to save the logged information. 
3. Ability to close and clear the logging tabs. 
4. Ability to change the logging font. 
5. Diffrent colors for diffrent levels of error. Green = Info, Orange = Warn, Red = Error
6. Line and file information. I guess that is it. 
7. It currently works for Content Pipeline and TowerDefence (D side)

What is left to do in the context of logging?
1. Use it on the phone. 

Plan of attack --- 

Run the logging on the main thread. 
Simply Connect to the UDP service. 
Log messages features -> File-Line information (This is worthless in lua atm)
Other then that its just good to go. bnjkgl;
