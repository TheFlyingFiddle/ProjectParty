Logging now works on the phone but the debugging process has been painfull.
What have i learned in the process? 
Do not program on the surface it fucking sucks as. 
I need to buy an usb hub. 

In C things have a tendency to work when they should not work. ( This is confusing :( )


What have i done since the last journal entry? 

UDP service system. 

How does it work?

1. Send a broadcast message to servicePort. (There is only one service port ATM)
2. When a service provider gets the message it sends back a message containing all 
relevant service information.

Message Example: 

Client A: Sends message -> [ LOGGING_SERVICE ] to servicePort broadcasted.
LOGGING Service: Gets message sends back -> [LOGGING_SERVICE, IP, PORT] (Specific Message for logging service)
